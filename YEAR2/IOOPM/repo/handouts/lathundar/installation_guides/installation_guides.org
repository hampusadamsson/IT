* Installing IOOPM Software
  There is a frequent question about how to install gcc, emacs and --
  *recently* -- the Java Development Kit on a variety of operating
  systems. We therefore decided to provide this little guide for your
  convenience.

** Ubuntu
*** Gcc + Emacs
    - Open a terminal :: Click on the Ubuntu Logo in the top right and
         type "terminal". Pause a second to complain about the
         advertisements you're seeing. Now press <enter>.
 
         [[./ubuntu_open_terminal.png]]
    - Install GCC + Emacs :: execute this following line, then enter your password:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential emacs24
#+END_SRC

*** Java (JDK)
    - Open a terminal :: Click on the Ubuntu Logo in the top right and
         type "terminal". Now press <enter>.
    - execute this line, then enter your password:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk
#+END_SRC

    - Confirm that the JDK is installed :: The line

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
java --version
#+END_SRC

      should output something similar to:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
java version "1.7.0_21"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_21-b12)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.21-b01, mixed mode)
#+END_SRC
** Mac OS X
*** GCC
    - Open the App Store :: press [apple-key+<space>] and type "App Store<enter>"
    - Install Xcode :: Type "xcode<enter>" into the search bar in the
                       top right. Click on the Xcode application and
                       on the install button. This will give you gcc,
                       alongside Apple's Xcode IDE.
                       
                       [[./xcode_in_app_store.png]]
    - Install Command Line Tools :: start Xcode, enter the "Settings"
         dialog (by pressing [apple-key+,]) and go to the "Downloads"
         section. There, install the "Command Line Tools".

*** Emacs
    Follow the instructions in the piazza thread [[https://piazza.com/class/hkjhvzyqnp52on?cid%3D11][Emacs f√∂r mac samt
    iCal-prenumerationer]].

      *Congratulations, you're done!*
*** Java (JDK)
    - Download the .dmg :: Go to
         http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html
         and download the installer for OS X.
    - Install :: Once downloaded, open the .dmg file and follow the
                 installation instructions. You will be prompted to
                 enter your password.
    - Confirm that the JDK is installed :: The line

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
java --version
#+END_SRC

      should output something similar to:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
java version "1.7.0_21"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_21-b12)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.21-b01, mixed mode)
#+END_SRC
** Windows
*** Virtualbox
    - Virtualbox :: Download and install [[https://www.virtualbox.org/][Virtualbox]].
    - Ubuntu :: Download an up-to-date version of ubuntu as .iso-file
                from [[http://www.ubuntu.com]].
    - Create a Virtualbox Virtual Machine :: Start Virtualbox and
         click "New". Call your machine "Ubuntu" and the wizard will
         walk you through it.
    - Pick the ISO :: Use the ubuntu-iso as virtual CD :: Go to the
         settings of your newly created Virtual Machine, click on the
         CD icon. Choose the .iso file containing your ubuntu
         distribution.

         [[./windows_pick_iso.png]]

         Close the settings dialog.
    - Start the Virtual Machine :: Doubleclick on the Virtual Machine
         you created and configured, it will boot. Exciting, right? :)
    - Install Ubuntu :: Just follow the simple wizard and you'll be
                        fine. (Btw, when asked whether it's ok to delete the
                        contents of the hard drive: yes it is, the
                        "hard drive" of your ubuntu is just a file on
                        your actual hard drive.)
    - Goto Ubuntu :: Log in and continue at the instructions for Ubuntu above.

      *Congratulations, you're almost done!*
